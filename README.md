# eliza

### About

This is an implementation of Eliza built in pure Javascript. I wanted to build it on a MERN stack but my starting point is in just JS.

### Running

You have two options:

**Option #1:**
It's hosted on Github Pages at http://kweaver00.github.io/eliza/.


**Option #2:**
Just open the index HTML file on your local machine, so [this one](./index.html).


### Why JS?

Because you can run a JS file on any browser or any computer.
